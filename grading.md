# Grading

Working with tangible or digital substances provides an opportunity for quick assessment. If your code and processes are correct, it should work. If it isn’t working, there is something wrong with the code or the process. In this class, we will have many exercises dealing with web scripting and database (db) manipulation. If the db looks like it’s supposed to, it works. If the page operates like expected, it works. Getting your code and the exercise to work makes up the majority of your grade. However, button pushing isn’t the only skill involved. It is important that you understand the bigger picture including what is happening behind the scenes, trends in the industry, design questions which face database and web developers and designers and issues you might face in your coming or present situations. It’s not enough to be a code jockey!
