# Github: Adding a Collaborator

**Goal: By the end of this document, you will know how to add a collaborator to your** [**Github.com**](http://github.com) **account and added me as a collaborator to your info2480 project**

We’ve talked about how git is used to share code between developers and then created a repo cloned it to your local machine. The next step is to invite someone to work on your project with you. In this case, in order to make it easier for me to help debug code and fix problems, I’d request that you make me a collaborator on your project.

1. Log into your Github account and go to your repository  for this class.
2. Click on the Settings button in the menu bar
3. From the left hand menu, click on Collaborators. You might need to go through authentication again. &#x20;
4. Click on the green button - ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)and enter `daniel-card` into the text box and Choose my name or user name when it appears.
5. Click the `Add daniel-card to this repository` button
6. I’ll be notified via my Github inbox to accept the collaboration.

I will leave this as an optional exercise since I can’t very well mandate that you give me access to your project or any aspect of your account but it would make things a bit easier when we get into the coding aspects of the class.
