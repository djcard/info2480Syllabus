# Git Wrap Up

So how does git relate to our class?&#x20;

Starting in Week 5, we are going to be working on a our final projects with each week building on the previous one.  At the start of the course, you'll receive a few files which be the foundation. For each new document (or as often as you like), you'll branch off the main or master branch of your working web site, do the exercise and, when it's complete and working, merge it into your main branch to be published or sent up to the server.&#x20;
