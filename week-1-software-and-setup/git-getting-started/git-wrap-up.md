# Git Wrap Up

So how does git relate to our class?&#x20;

Next, we are going to turn our attention to Github.com and work on moving files back and forth from there. After that, I will be able to collaborate with your on your code for this class. Starting in a few weeks, we are going to be working on a our final projects. Each week, we will make a new branch and use that branch to do that week's tasks. We'll get them working and when we're satisfied, you'll merge them into your master branch and commit them so each week will work on the previous one. &#x20;
