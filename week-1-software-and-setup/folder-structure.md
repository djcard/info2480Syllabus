# Folder Structure

**`TLDR : Skip to the last item to see absolutely essential info about your class folder structure.`**

How you set up your folders is important in that it can make your life easier or more complicated. A large part of any web design (or any software design project for that matter) is getting your files in the right place at the right time. You want your folder structure to be clear, intuitive and, above all, easy!

Since each developer / designer has their own way of thinking, your structure might deviate slightly from this but make sure it makes sense and works for you. To start off, make a folder on your hard drive which is going to house all of your web projects which I’ll call “sites”. Under that, make a folder for each “client” you have. This “client” level might include actual clients, personal projects, experimental sites and whatever you choose. The next level down is an actual project for that client.

```
Sites
    Client
        Project
```

Here is a more detailed example with real world clients and projects

```
Sites – The folder housing all of my projects
    AMS – a “client”

        AMSLive – a project

        AMSConversion – a project

    UML – a “client”

        SP21 – a project

        FA21 – a project

        SU22 – a project

    MyStuff – you are your own “client”

        LearnReact – a project

        CFSamples – a project

        PersonalIntranet – a project
```

For this class I'd suggest doing something like this:

```
Sites – houses all your web projects
    UML – houses all your UML coursework
        WebDataImplementation – the work for this class
            practiceGit - a project in this class
            ongoingWork - the main folder for your classwork
            
```

If you're on a Windows machine and `sites` was in your root folder, that would be `C:\Sites\UML\WebDataImplementation`

**At the very minimum, you will need to start this course with a dedicated folder for all your work.**\
