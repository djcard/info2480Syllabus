# Installing Command Box

CommandBox (CB) developed by OrtusSolutions ([http://www.ortussolutions.com](http://www.ortussolutions.com))  is a Command Line Interface (“CLI”) which makes many routine and complex tasks easier. If you have used any modern JavaScript tools, particularly node, CommandBox has many of the same functions as NPM. **If you have never used those tools, that is perfectly ok as well.**

While CommandBox has a number of features built in to it, we are going to focus mainly on two of them which are

1. The embedded server
2. The package manager

In order to use your web site truly as it is intended to be used by the rest of the world, it is important to view your site being served from a web server rather than just clicking on FILE —> OPEN in a browser. In order to develop ColdFusion applications, it is essential to have a ColdFusion server to handle the CF language. This is comparable to needing a PHP server to process PHP scripts, the Java RunTime Engine to run Java commands and Node server to handle server side Javascript code. CB allows us to solve both of these problems very very easily.

Before CB, setting up a webserver meant doing complex installs of web server software such as Microsoft IIS or the Apache web server in conjunction with a CF engine such as Adobe ColdFusion, Lucee or Railo. However, CB makes it very easy to put a development server in place to speed up your workflow.

There are basically three steps to installing and using CommandBox

1. Downloading the software
2. Unzipping and running the software for the first time
3. Testing the software to become familiar with it.
