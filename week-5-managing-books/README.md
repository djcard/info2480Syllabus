# Week 5: Managing Books

So far we've created our articles page. This included a management page to create and edit articles and a display them on a public page. This system is roughly the entire process of app and webpage development - develop a model (data base or table), create a UI and connect the two. Our articles only had 3 fields. The books in our bookstore have many more but the principles remain the same.&#x20;

This week we are going to dive in to modelling by creating the data tables which will house our book data.&#x20;
