# Journals

The Journal section of Blackboard is a private “blog” for your use. For some assignments, I will want you to review the process you used to arrive at the conclusion. One of the goals of this class is to learn the common processes that you will use in your future endeavors and not just proving that you can follow directions. The Journals are a way for you to document your own thoughts and even warnings to yourself about what you need to avoid for next time. Journals a private and are only viewable by you and the instructor.
