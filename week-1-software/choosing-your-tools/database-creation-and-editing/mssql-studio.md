### Installing SQL Management Studio

SQL Studio is the program we will use to manage the databases we create in MSSQL.

* Navigate to the file you downloaded earlier.
* Double Click on the file to start the installation.
* Follow the installation directions.

### Connecting to SQL Server

* Open SQL Management Studio
* If the Connect To Server Window does not open, choose FILE â€”> CONNECT OBJECT EXPLORER
* The Server name is [comweb.uml.edu](http://comweb.uml.edu) and your Login is your ftpUserName. The port is 51433 which, for SQL Studio, is put next to the URL separated by a **comma**. This is only needed in SQL STUDIO. Other programs will probably allow you to change the port using other means.

* Once the Management Studio connects you will see a DB named after you in the left hand pane. For now, just leave it alone until we get to that point in the course.
