# Getting Started

The “Getting Started” step consists of four steps

1. Setting up “general software” that is used for your entire UML experience, not just this class
2. Viewing your folder on the class webpage
3. Setting up a folder structure on your computer
4. Setting up your local development environment

The public web site is where your course projects and most of the exercises will take place. You will occasionally turn in materials via Blackboard but the point of the web is that your content can be found and viewed in a browser so that is how we are going to do most of our work.

All of the work you do will start on your own computer and then be transferred to the class servers. This document is the start of setting up your overall work space.

**Note**: This document uses “ftpUserName” as a place holder for the username you’ve received for this class. This will more than likely be in the form of firstname\_lastname.
