# Opening Your Class Web Site Online.

* Open a Browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc)
* Go to [http://comweb.uml.edu](http://comweb.uml.edu)[\*/](http://comweb.uml.edu/username)ftpUserName\*
* If you see a welcome message with your name on it, you have successfully found your site. If you do not, please check your spelling and Internet connection. If that does not fix the problem, please let me know immediately.

If you click on “What is this page” you will see a quick description. Under that is a list of the folders that are in your web space. If you click on one of them, it will open in a new window. If you create a new folder, you will see it automatically here on your front page.
