# Course Vocabulary List

**Working Environment**: The software that you use to create the day to day assignments ranging from papers to code to graphics. This is your space to practice, produce drafts, make notes to yourself etc.

**Testing Environment**: The collection of hardware, software and services where work is posted which is meant to be proofread or debugged by others but has not been “signed off” for final production. (note: in this class we don’t set up a testing environment per se. However, I do recommend you have someone try out your pages or proof your text before it is uploaded to the Production Server)

**Production Environment**: This is the collection of hardware, software and services which publish your work to the world (or to the class). This is your “final draft” which, in this class, according to the assignment guidelines, is the online server.

Have a great semester and see you in chat!
