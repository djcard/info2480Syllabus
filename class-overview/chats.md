# Chats

We will be using the chat function in Blackboard often. Chats are voluntary but encouraged. They are a time to ask questions, hear perspectives on the content both from the instructor and from other students, and to go more deeply into the topics. All chats will be recorded and posted if you cannot join us. The chat schedule will be posted in Blackboard. We will try to mix up the chat times so that there will be at least some times that work for you. See [Chat Schedule](https://www.notion.so/UML-14b1579117d64568bfb740a43ebc1e75?p=862d3fe34c7b4741944cff0000407e89\&showMoveTo=true#\_Chat\_Schedule:) above for times and process. There will be two required chats during the semester which are the Mid-Point “Process Check” chat and final Wrap Up. Additionally, we will have an optional chat each week to help as we go through the semester. This class covers a great deal of material and concepts and meeting in a more “multi-sensory” way can be helpful. There will be a forum in the discussion boards which will be specifically for questions you wish answered in the next chat.
