# General

Whenever people interact, whether it’s face to face or online, there are at least three things which help guide the interaction. These are ideas, people and actions.

In this class, ideas are open to respectful discussion, questioning and debate and are meant to be subjected to verification by facts, other ideas and, to a degree, personal experience. Ideas are meant to have their pros and cons assessed. An idea is not the same as the person who proposed it, no matter how closely that idea is held by the person. A person is human being with infinite value who is worthy of respect, regardless of who they are. All of the interactions in this course, even if you are disagreeing with a person’s ideas, will be conducted with this in mind. We can disagree with an idea without being caustic, rude or belittling (to either the idea or the person). Actions are isolated behaviors by an individual whether they are acting alone or as part of a group. Attacking a person instead of assessing an idea is an action which will not be tolerated. The use of rude or offensive language are also unacceptable. You are responsible for your actions in this class. I ask again, is the experience going to be better or worse because of your presence?
