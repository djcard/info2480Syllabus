## Course Description&#x20;

It is almost impossible to think about creating any sort of modern web site or application without the use of databases and at least a cursory knowledge of how they work. Almost everything online uses a database at some level whether it is an ultra-complex system such as Facebook or Amazon.com, a prepackaged tool such as Drupal or Wordpress, or a relatively simple site which requires a log on to gain access to some content. This course is designed to provide a straightforward but comprehensive overview of what these systems are, how they work, and how they can be incorporated into your projects.

&#x20;

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, the students will demonstrate the ability to:&#x20;

1. Basic knowledge of Web Development tools such as git, IDEs, and CLIs
2. Ability to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a working User Interface (UI)
3. Understanding of MVC and separation of concerns when it comes to web development
4. Ability to create and edit data tables and basic Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete ( CRUD ) SQL
5. Basic to intermediate programming concepts and techniques such as using objects, arrays, loops, scopes, classes and functions.
6. Combine all of the above techniques to create a working and searchable book repository, user login and simple content management system.

&#x20;

## Textbook/Readings&#x20;

The majority of the content is found in the online textbook at [https://book.umlinfo2480.com/](https://book.umlinfo2480.com/). Additional materials if desired can be found at:

* [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/](https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/)
* [https://modern-cfml.ortusbooks.com/](https://modern-cfml.ortusbooks.com/)

&#x20;

## General Information&#x20;

This class is primarily about building databases and making them accessible via websites. At the end of it, you will have created a searchable "bookstore" which has public facing pages where a user can

* &#x20;Search for a book by title or genre and be presented with one, many or zero options
* Create an account and password
* View articles and other information about the store such as hours and short articles

It will also include a management portion where an employee can

* Enter new books into the database
* Edit information about books already in the database
* Manage information such as new genres, publishers and so on.&#x20;

As we create these things, we are also going to use many of the tools which are common by professional developers including

* &#x20;Command Line Interface (CLI) tools
* Git - a version control system&#x20;
* Github.com - an online tool which uses version control tools to help developers collaborate on code
* Development tools including code hinting, code folding, and sytax highlighting
* Debugging tools such as line breaks
* Good Architecture practices such as the MVC model and separation of concerns&#x20;

We will be using a new language called BoxLang which has a rich ecosystem of development tools and a syntax which is easy to learn with a minimum of overheard and "boilerplate" typing necessary which allows us to focus on the main code of our project. In additional to being powerful and versatile in its own right, the concepts we learn in this class are transferrable too nearly any other programming language so there is no fear of being "locked in" to using a particular language.

\
Hopefully we'll have some fun along the way as well. &#x20;

## Teaching Methods: &#x20;

The course primarily consists of hands on web development combined with reading to provide background and concepts and journals to encourage reflection on the lessons learned during the creation process.&#x20;

&#x20;

## Attendance and Participation:&#x20;

Attendance for online classes is a bit more nebulous than in person classes. Participation in the discussion forums is expected.&#x20;

We will have chats every week. Although these chats are optional, they are highly recommended. As opposed to the discussion threads, chats are held in “real time”. Chats are held once a week. As I get to know the class, I might add more times to accommodate special schedules or time zones.

Likewise, if I should become ill or need to miss class, I will communicate with you via Blackboard and/or Email as soon as possible with clear instructions.   &#x20;

A note on Zoom (or Blackboard Collaborate) Participation: It is strongly recommended and requested that you keep cameras on during class. This tends to improve engagement and helps me better assess everyone's comprehension. In this class students are expected to keep their on cameras on during class (or you may narrow this to “during lectures or discussion”) unless you have a valid reason not to, which you should discuss with me ahead of time. Occasionally turning your camera off during class to attend to a distraction is fine.

&#x20;&#x20;

## Assessment and Evaluation Methods:&#x20;

Working with tangible or digital substances provides an opportunity for quick assessment. If your code and processes are correct, it should work. If it isn’t working, there is something wrong with the code or the process. In this class, we will have many exercises dealing with web scripting and database (db) manipulation. If the db looks like it’s supposed to, it works. If the page operates like expected, it works. Getting your code and the exercise to work makes up the majority of your grade. However, button pushing isn’t the only skill involved. It is important that you understand the bigger picture including what is happening behind the scenes, trends in the industry, design questions which face database and web developers and designers and issues you might face in your coming or present situations. It’s not enough to be a code jockey!

## Tutoring Resources and Centers for Learning and Academic Support Services (CLASS):

CLASS will be offering tutoring and Writing Center services virtually this fall. [Online searchable tutoring schedules](https://www.uml.edu/class/tutoring/tutor-schedule/default.aspx) are available that include resources on all campuses.

&#x20;

## Student Mental Health and Well-being &#x20;

We are a campus that cares about the mental health and well-being of all individuals in our campus community, particularly during this uncertain time. If you or someone you know are experiencing mental health challenges at UMass Lowell, please contact [Counseling Services](https://www.uml.edu/student-services/counseling/), who are offering remote counseling via telehealth for all enrolled, eligible UMass Lowell students who are currently residing in Massachusetts or New Hampshire.  In addition, a crisis counsellor is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 855-890-2879.

I am available to talk with you about stresses related to your work in my class. &#x20;

&#x20;

## Disability Services

If you have a documented disability that will require classroom accommodations, please notify me as soon as possible, so that we might make appropriate arrangements. Please speak to me during office hours or send me an email, as I want to protect your privacy. Visit the [Student Disability Services webpage](https://www.uml.edu/student-services/Disability/) for further information and to register with that office if you require accommodations.

Additionally, Student Disability Services supports software for ALL students. Read\&Write Gold is literacy software that allows you to read on-screen text aloud, research and check written work, and create study guides. You can download the software from the IT Software webpage on the UML website: [IT Software page](https://www.uml.edu/IT/Services/Software/Read-Write-Gold.aspx)

&#x20;

## Academic Integrity Policy:&#x20;

Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work and are held to the highest standards of integrity. Please review the [University policy regarding academic integrity](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/undergraduate/policies/academic-policies/academic-integrity.aspx). If you choose to remain in this course, you must agree that you will neither give nor receive any unauthorized help on your homework, papers, exams, or other work. &#x20;

Outline clearly your own policies for academic integrity. &#x20;

&#x20;

## Credit Hour Policy&#x20;

Federal definition of a credit hour requires that for every course credit awarded, a course must offer 15 hours of instructor-led course activities and 30 hours of out-of-class student work.  This means that a standard 3 credit hour course requires 45 hours of instructor-led course activities and 90 hours of out-of-class student work.

&#x20;

## University Privacy Statement

UMass Lowell recognizes the importance of mutual trust between students and faculty. Neither faculty nor students may record video or audio of a course or private conversation without all parties' consent. Massachusetts is a two-party consent state, which means it is illegal to record someone without their permission. Recordings of classroom lectures are the intellectual property of the instructor. Instructors have the right to prohibit audio and video recording of their lectures, unless the requesting student is registered with Disabilities Services and recording of class sessions is an approved accommodation. In addition, sharing of or selling recordings of classroom activity, discussions or lectures with any other person or medium without permission of the instructor is prohibited.

Students should expect that chat sessions will be recorded and made available on demand to members of the class through Blackboard. This is true whether it is announced during the chat or not.&#x20;

## Late Work&#x20;

In this class, each week involves work and concepts which build on the previous weeks so it is highly encouraged that you keep as up to date as possible. However, life happens and sometimes things needs to take higher priority than the weeks assignments. If you find yourself getting behind in the class or there are extenuating circumstances which I should know about, please reach out to me. <br>

## Course Outline & Class Schedule:&#x20;

&#x20;The course outline is available on Blackboard and will be tailored to your specific semester and pace.&#x20;
