# Mail (My Messages)

Mail is meant for private questions and concerns which are not for the general reading. I will usually be able to check mail messages by 8pm each day. Please check your messages each day in case of updates or changes to the course materials or schedule. This course mandates you use the built in mail program in Blackboard and not your personal email.
