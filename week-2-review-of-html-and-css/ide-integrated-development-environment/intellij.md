# IntelliJ

### Background

IntelliJ from Jet Brains is a higher end development environment that has a very generous student license.

There are 5 steps to setting up IntelliJ as your IDE:

1. Register for the student license
2. Download the trial software and Installing the software
3. Creating a project for your website

### Registering for the student license

Visit [http://www.jetbrains.com/student/](http://www.jetbrains.com/student/) the click on Apply Now. Follow the directions and make sure you use your UML email address. You will be sent a license or a login which you can use as long as you’re a student.

## Installing IntelliJ

### Downloading the Software

1. Visit [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and click on download. Choose the Ultimate version.

### Installing the software

1. Run the downloaded exe file and follow the instructions. This can be installed anywhere.

## Creating a project

Projects are made up of all the files that go into make a final product. For some languages this can include all sorts of libraries, dependencies, modules, outside programming and more. However, for our purposes, we are not using any of those so the process is very straightforward.

1. Click on File —> Open
2. Navigate to the root of your website. If you followed the suggestions in the Folder Structure section, that would be Sites/UML/WebDataImplementation/ongoingWork
3. Click Finish. If asked, open the project in a new window.
