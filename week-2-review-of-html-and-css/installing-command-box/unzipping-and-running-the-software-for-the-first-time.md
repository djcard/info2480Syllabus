# Unzipping and Running the Software for the first time

1. Go to the .zip file you just downloaded and unzip it into the “Sites” folder which you set up above. It can actually go anywhere you choose but for current and future ease of use, extract it into the Sites folder.
2. Open your sites folder. You will see a program called box. Run Box and after a few seconds where it does some configuration, you’ll see the CommandBox prompt
3. You’ve installed CommandBox.
