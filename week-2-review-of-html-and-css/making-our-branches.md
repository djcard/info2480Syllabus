# Making Our Branches

## Creating a "Point In Time" branch in SourceTree

A "Point in Time" branch is simply a branch in a git repository which is meant to capture and retain what a project looked like at a particular point. There is nothing special or magical about it other than it exists and we can revert our project back to it if we decide to.

1. Open up SourceTree and make sure you have the Main or Master branch of your project selected and in bold in the left hand menu.
2. Create a new branch called `pointInTime/original by  clicking` on the Branch Icon in the top toolbar and typing in the name
3. Double click on Main in the left menu to go back to the main branch.&#x20;

## Creating our working branch for this week

1. In SourceTree, make sure that your Main or Master branch is in bold in the left menu
2. Create a new branch called week2 by clicking on the Branch icon in the top toolbar and typing in the name.
3. Leave that branch checked out while we do our work for this week.
