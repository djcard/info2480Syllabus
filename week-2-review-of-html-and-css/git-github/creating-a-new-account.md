# Creating a New Account

You will need to have a free account on Github.com in order to complete the class.&#x20;

1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and click on Sign up in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
2. Enter your email (personal or school, it doesn't matter), a password and a username and click Continue.&#x20;
3. Complete the remainder of the steps. You might be asked about Multi Factor Authentication. You use the Github.com app on your phone, receive text messages or even use the same Authenticator app that you use for your UML login.
