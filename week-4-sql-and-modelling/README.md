# Week 4: SQL and Modelling

Learning the "what" to do and "how" to do it is important but without "why", "for whom" it only stays as academic information. This week, we are looking at user profiles - defining the "for whom" we are doing this project and our end goals - the "why".&#x20;

Once we have those in place, we are will jump back into the "what and how" by looking at the SQL language to show our edited data on the public pages of the the web page.&#x20;
