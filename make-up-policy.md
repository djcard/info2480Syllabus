Things happen. That being said there is a lot of work in this class. The deadlines and assignments are there to help break the learning process into bite size chunks to prevent overload. It is possible to turn materials in up to two weeks after their due date. The first week afterward will be for 80% of what you would have received. The second week after it was due will be for 70% of what you would have received. Since every assignment builds on the one before it, it is highly recommended that you do not fall behind. The best code in the tech industry is not written by procrastinators and people binging on Mountain Dew and Red Bull so they can stay up for three days straight [(](http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)[Donâ€™t believe me](http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)[?](http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)). If you do fall behind or life events occur which contribute to a difficulty in completing tasks on time, please talk to me. Depending on the situation, we might be able to work on a schedule that will help you keep pace with the class and work with your situation on an individual basis.
